Average Cost of Door Installation in Calgary
The cost to install a door in Calgary typically ranges from $400 to $1,600, depending on the type and complexity of the job. For basic interior door installation, homeowners might spend as little as $150 to $300. However, for exterior doors that require framing, insulation, and additional weatherproofing, the price can go up significantly, often exceeding $1,000.

These prices include labor, basic materials, and minor adjustments. However, several key factors will influence the final quote.

Factors Affecting Door Installation Cost
1. Type of Door
The door type is the most significant cost variable. Here's a breakdown:

Interior Doors: Hollow-core or MDF doors are the most affordable. Prices range between $150 and $400 including labor.

Exterior Doors: Solid wood, fiberglass, or steel doors are more expensive. Including installation, they typically cost between $800 and $2,500.

Sliding Glass Doors: Often used for patios, these range from $900 to $2,000, especially when factoring in track alignment and sealing.

French Doors: Known for aesthetics and openness, these start at $1,000 and may go up to $3,000 depending on material and hardware.

2. Door Material
Material affects both price and performance:

Wood: Classic and attractive but needs maintenance. Higher cost.

Steel: Offers strength and durability at a reasonable price.

Fiberglass: Energy efficient and resistant to wear. Mid to high price range.

Glass: Adds elegance and light, but typically more expensive.

3. Labor Costs
In Calgary, the average door installer charges between $70 to $120 per hour. Basic installations take 2–4 hours, while complex tasks involving structural modifications can take an entire day.

4. Framing and Structural Changes
If your doorway needs resizing or framing, costs can rise sharply. Framing can add $200–$600 to the bill.

5. Hardware and Accessories
Handles, locks, hinges, kick plates, weatherstripping, and deadbolts are often priced separately. Premium hardware packages can cost an additional $100 to $300.

Energy Efficiency and Door Installation
In a city like Calgary, where winters are long and harsh, energy-efficient doors are essential. A poorly insulated door can lead to heat loss and increased energy bills. Modern exterior doors are designed with energy efficiency in mind and come with features such as:

Weather stripping

Foam core insulation

Double or triple-pane glass inserts

Although these doors are costlier upfront, they provide long-term savings and improve your home's comfort and sustainability.

When to Replace Your Door
Many homeowners don't realize how much a new door can improve their home's performance. Here are signs it’s time to replace your door:

Drafts around the frame
